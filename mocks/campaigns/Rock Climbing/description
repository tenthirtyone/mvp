Aubrey and Ashley are going to climb as many feet as they can to raise money for this campaign. 

You can support us two ways,

1) Direct Donations
2) Pledge per foot climbed

Aubrey and Ashley are experienced climbers and will limit themselves to one day of climbing. 

They will provide maps of their chosen routes and submit image and video of their climb post-campaign.
